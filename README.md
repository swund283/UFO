# UFO
in this module.  we used a static data set that we import into as JS app.  The app cleans up the data in to a structured dataset that we then use JS on the front end to pass user inputed filters back.  With the combination of the front end user inputs to the datastructre on the back we present the user, via a webpage, the filtered info.
